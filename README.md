TODO:

- make JS object oriented, remove repeated calls to the same element
(define thing once and call that variable), just clean stuff up and
- make code simpler
- split each actual piece of JS code apart, nopo, photoset resize,
the buttons, etc.
- add new tumblr code features, support ads (??)
- get rid of emojis? (most browsers/platforms support them natively now)
- more stuff!
